# Final_Project_ML
Detecting the insincere questions posted on Quora is a classical text classification problem.
We implements and evaluates the performances of some frequently used text classification models: Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), Support Vector
Machine (SVM), SVM with NB feature (NB-SVM) model and Convolutional neural network (CNN). We also demonstrate the process of creating our
own models, CNN-LSTM model and CNN-GRU model.
